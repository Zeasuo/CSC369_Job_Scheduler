Discussion:
Assuming jobs keep being submitted by users, starvation can happen when
a job is asking for a resource that is locked by another job for a long time.
For example, job A only needs resource A to execute, and job B needs all the resources
to be executed. Assume job B gets put into its corresponding execution thread 
before job A and locked resource A. Now if job B need to waited for a long time to get other
resources required, then job A will be waiting for the same amount of time as Job B.
But ideally, Job A only need to one resource. In this case, Job B is causing starvation.
